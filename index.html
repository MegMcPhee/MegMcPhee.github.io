<h3>I am a Cyber Security Professional looking for opportunities 
    to further my knowledge in the field. I am currently pursuing my
    Masters of Science in Cyber Security, as well as, my Masters in 
    Business Administration. I am a novice to coding, working with 
    JavaScript and Python mostly, but enjoy it immensely. I work well 
    in teams or individually. I am a goal oriented person, I multitask
    projects, and I deliver results. I am a great problem solver which
    is one reason I chose this profession. I enjoy the Cyber Security 
    field very much and look forward to a lifelong career.</h3>
<h4>HOLY POO</h4>
